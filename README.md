# Plotify 📈

Draw a curve, and Plotify will automatically determine the best-fitting linear, quadratic, or exponential function.

> A modern, interactive function plotter that uses regression analysis to estimate mathematical functions from hand-drawn curves.

## What is it? 🤔

Plotify is a web application that allows users to:

- Draw curves on an interactive canvas
- Get real-time mathematical function estimates
- Switch between linear, quadratic, and exponential regression
- Adjust grid density and zoom levels
- See confidence scores for the estimated functions

Perfect for educators, students, or anyone interested in visualizing mathematical functions!

## Getting Started 🚀

```sh
# Navigate to the project directory
cd plotify

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the development server
pnpm dev
```
